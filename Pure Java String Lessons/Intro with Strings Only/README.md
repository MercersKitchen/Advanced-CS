# Pure Java String Introduction
Review of Object Orientated Programming through Pure Java

Students have Experience with Pong and AP Videos

Purpose of Using Pure Java directly with the Java Compiler through a Command Terminal ...
- introduction to terminal work for developing (navigating pathways, working with bytecode)
- develop an interesting text-only program using pure java's built-in args array
- Building a Routine for writing Pure Java using the CMD.exe (needed for more advanced programming applications)

## Note Taking App

See: https://github.com/QEHS-PureJava/Ideas-and-Notes
See Groceries Project for a List of Concepts and Ideas:

See Article: https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/use-browser-notepad/
- ```data:text/html, <html contenteditable>```
- instant notepad in the active tab
- The code works with most browsers and the notepad itself works offline. It’s best to use this one as a temporary solution because your notes will disappear when you close the tab.

# Tools Used Here

- WINDOWS Folders
- CMD.exe
  - Note: able to use PowerShell but instruction will use CMD.exe
  - Similar to Terminal in Linux (Raspberry Pi Computer) and utilizing devices built for Internet of Things
- WYSIWYG: Atom (students are able to use text editor of their choice as long as multiple files open concurrently, like Notepad++)
- JDK (use most recent version unless using EPS-Schoolzone, See BYOD, <a href="https://github.com/MercersKitchen/BYOD#for-computers-using-schoolzone-all-or-powerteacher">Click Here</a>)
- Verify the Environmental Variables (My Computer / Properties / Advanced System Settings (System Properties) / Environmental / User Variables / Path / Edit)
  - Find the JDK bin and the JRE bin
  - For Example
    - C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_121\bin
    - C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_121\bin

Review of JAVAC Complier
- Reads Java using 3 locators
  1. Main Program matches Folder name
  2. Main Program's first line within ```public static void main (String[] args)```

- Compared to Processing-JAVA
  - Folder and Program Name match
  - Main Program contains
    ```java
    void setup() {}
    void draw() {}
    ```

Using the JAVAC Compiler: compiling Java, creating Bytecode, executing Bytecode
- NOTE: Bytecode will run on multiple platforms (Windows, Mac, and various microcontrollers like alarm clocks) ... Java is everywhere
. Create GitHub repository and add a .txt document, extension changed to .java
1. SHIFT-LeftClick on Folder
   - OR
   - Open CMD.exe
   - Open Window and Copy Pathway to Program intended
     - For Example: C:\Users\mmercer\Documents\GitHub\CS30\Pure Java\Hello World and Java Doc\HelloWorld
   - Changing Drive letters, type ```c:```
   - Adding pathway: type ```cd C:\Users\mmercer\Documents\GitHub\CS30\Pure Java\Hello World and Java Doc\HelloWorld```
   - Then should be able to run the javac and java commands below
2. Run CMD: "Open Command Window Here"
3. Creating Bytecode: type ```javac [program name, exact spelling].java```
   - Compiles Java
   - Will return all errors here
4. UP-ARROW to access previous typing
   - Command Line and Typing Commands is very different than finding buttons to press
   - Compensation, computer remembers what you typed
5. Using CTRL-ARROWS to skip typing
6. Executing Bytecode: type ```java [program name, exact spelling]```

# Create Simple Hello World Program
- ID Driver Method within Main Program with matching folder name
- Discuss each word in terms of meaning
- Discuss concept that Java natively accepts strings
- Review basic Java Documentation File
- Review ```println``` in Pure Java

- Creating Folder, Naming must match Class Programming for
- Introduction to
  CMD
  javac
  java
- What is created in the folder
- Template for Hello World Program

Breakdown of Hello World Program
```java
//Writing your first class
//Break down each line of code - Review Processing Java

public class HelloWorld{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("/nHello, world!/n"); //Character escapes to format output
    }
}

//public: everyone can access it
//class: blueprint for objects, all information should be encapuslated
//static: do not need to instanciate an object
//void: does not return anything

/*main(String[] args): method named main, which takes one argument named args,
                       which is an array of Strings
  - Looks for this method, like Processing looks for void setup & draw
  - Thus, this method must be STATIC
  */
/*System.out.println: supplies strings to the command prompt
  Remember: dereference or "."
  System: predefined class in Java
  Out: System contains static class named "out"
  Println: one object in "out" that prints to cmd or console
  Note: "Out" has many accessible objects, "out" is one of them
  */
//Websites for help: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/
  //Change 6 to 8 or 9 for more information
```

# Supply String using CMD

Hello World Example - Supplying CMD Array Content
```JAVA
/*
  To execute: supply cmd line arguments
  "java HelloWorld testing abc 123"
*/

public class HelloWorld{
    public static void main(String[] args){
        System.out.println("Printing command-line arguments:");
        for(int i = 0; i < args.length; i++){
            System.out.println("Args[" + i + "]: " + args[i]);
        }
        System.out.println("Done.");
    }
}
/*Note: &lt; is a symbole reference, is the same as <
  &gt;
  &le; is a symbole reference, is the same as <=
  &ge;
  CAUTION: &lt;= will only display <=, not compare
  See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5068951/what-do-lt-and-gt-stand-for

# Ideas to Include

Objects are:
- Group of variables declared and assigned per instance using Constructors and procedures
  - `this` and dereference
  - "An object knows about itself ..."
- Instance named like a variable
- Instances can be structured in an array (read and write)
- Instantiation happens in MAIN
- Encapsulation with access modifiers, getters and setters
- Different classes and instances can communicate through the MAIN Program

- https://web.archive.org/web/20160403181436/http://staticvoidgames.com:80/tutorials/objects/advancedInheritance
- Advanced Inheritance
  - Interfaces: methods that subclass must override
  - Abstract Class: common code between more than one class
  - Anonymous Classes: create a one-time extension of class that completes a behaviour one time
  - Final Classes: access modifier final, cannot be extended
