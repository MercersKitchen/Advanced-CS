Note: re-watch videos for all vocabulary words

Summary, See Course / Faculty Lectures by Unit: [1] Primitive Data Types in Java
- 2.41: simple Java Program (three different ways of declaring, assigning), remember global vs local and separated between geometry, strongly formatted language (different from other languages, amount of memory changes in strongly formatted), introduce static vs. dynamic programming in Processing-JAVA, must have decimal, create simple processing-JAVA, create simple driver-processing-Java, create simple driver-Processing-PureJava, memorize the amount of memory (time, 11:00), conserving memory as best practice, OOP creates data types that they need

Summary, see Course / Faculty Lectures by Unit: [2] What is Object-oriented Programming
- Machine language
- "Write programs to help them write machine language"
- Solve problems like a human being - what does this mean, method of thought (words, images, logic, emotions)
- Why is OOP a good way to solve problems: create objects, use Objects
- How do we define objects to solve problems
- A language is a way of thinking about a problem

Summary, See Course / Faculty Lectures by Unit: [1] Primitive Data Types in Java
- Tips for Booleans and IFs
- Emphasis on AP Exam
- These need to be practiced
- Mismatched formatting and punctuation - CONTROL-TAB to use IDE, use cursor to match blocks of code
- Single Statement IFs, unlocking a line of code
- Examples with code tracing
- Lesson from 0 - 18 minutes, graduates speaking from 18 minutes to the oriented

Summary, See Course / Faculty Lectures by Unit: [4] Four loops to while the time away
- Coding examples for coding a "Marquee"

Summary, see Course / Faculty Lectures by Unit: [5] Using Classes to define user defined data types
- grouping variables and how they are related
- define data & behaviours
- coding a social media example
