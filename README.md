Comment on Problem Solving ... what creates a problem?
- Teacher generated for a particular lesson
- Student generated to think through a problem
- What is real, what is abstracted (Big M Mathematics)

### Unit 1: [1] Why Programming? Why Java?
- Console Output
- Computer Setup | IDEs
- How Java Formatting and Compiler Interact (Folders and Main Program)
- Formatting of Program for Program (Encapsulation)
- Identification of Main Method
- Begin learning about objects (abstract definition)
- Using commenting to create human readable code
- How `;` creates machine executable code and linear reading (almost human readable)
- Difference between linear and dynamic programming
- Using String Literals, character escapes, concatenation
- Difference between single and double-quotes
- String Literals introducing syntax and logic errors (by compiler)
- Difference between pre-run errors (debugging line), run-time errors, exceptions, and logic errors (output still occurs)
- Detection of each of these errors
- Student Skill of APCSA Exam: read code, as a compiler, and identify and find all these errors

**Using Processing-JAVA**
- Introduction to Processing-JAVA IDE
- `print` | `println`
- Hello World Program: text to Console, visual data to Canvas

//Hello World
```
/* Programmer: Mr. Mercer
Date: 20210503
Purpose: Demonstrate the System Class Method

```


**Using Pure Java**
- System Class: `System.out.print` | `System.out.println`

**[OPTIONAL] Using JavaScript & Chrome**: UNDERCONSTRUCTION, see Websites

### Unit 1: [2] Variables and Data Types
- Program design to solve a problem or task (i.e. linear vs. dynamic currently)
- Computational Thinking: domain of values and operations need to produce needed output
- Primitive or reference data types (numbers or Booleans): Booleans (1 bit) int (32-bits), double (64-bits), floating point,
- Other Data types related to Processing-Java's Visual Processing
- In Java, Strings are Classes, not primitives
- Declaring variable types based on domain & number system, and memory needed
- Difference between global and local variables
- How to initialize variables (Processing-Java's Geometry Issue)
-  Modifier: final (constant), name is written in all CAPS
- Naming variables: snake, camel, 1D array

**Using Processing-JAVA**
**Using Pure Java**
**[OPTIONAL] Using JavaScript & Chrome**: UNDERCONSTRUCTION, see Websites

### Unit 1: [3] Expressions and Assignment Statements
- Arithmetic ()*/%+-
- Calculator project: printing buttons pressed, showing partial answers, showing final answers, maximizing memory by declaring correct variables based on domain
- Difference between "3" (three) and 3: numbers and literals
- Use casting, concatenation (introduction only, show an example only)
- integers answer in integers, with modulus
- floats and doubles can be formatted with specific decimals (truncated or rounded) by significant digits or "printing"
- Order of operations, including exponents and parenthesis, reading left to right, whatever order these are found
- ArithmeticException: divide by zero (use try-catch, if)
- NAN: not a number variable check
- flowchart about parsing numbers (logic games)
- numbers are literal values with magnitude (x=7 not same as 7=x, 7 has a fixed meaning, similar to keyword)
- what does = vs. == vs. === mean
- note: easist modulus problem is even, odd numbers
- math class: modulus problem, prime factoring (find primes, division rules to see if possible, representing in tree-diagram)

**Using Processing-JAVA**
**Using Pure Java**
**[OPTIONAL] Using JavaScript & Chrome**: UNDERCONSTRUCTION, see Websites

### Unit 1: [4] Compound Assignment Operators
- two step process: variable change, then assign or assign, then change variable
- short cuts in coding
- "counting formulae": lowest common multiples, great common factors, timers
- tracing code on paper (partner coding by printing code that works or partially works), what a complier does (HEAP Sheet)
- increment operator x++ (++x excluded): specific x+=1 or x=x+1
- decrement operator x-- (--x excluded): specific x-=1 or x=x-1

**Using Processing-JAVA**
**Using Pure Java**
**[OPTIONAL] Using JavaScript & Chrome**: UNDERCONSTRUCTION, see Websites

- using actual numbers with significant digits or casting using truncation
- using parsing
- Overflow error: between Integer.MIN_VALUE & Integer.MAX_VALUE
  2147483647 to -214748368
  Constants contained in Integer Class
- Overflow errors outputs unexpected numbers (called "roll overs")

### Unit 4: [1] WHILE Loops
- "When you do not know how many iterations you need"
- Note: pilot controls often use `while (true) {}`, also called an infinite loop since expression evaluates to "true" always
- need way of tracking when expression evaluates to false from within the WHILE Loop
- Mimic FOR Loop with unknown finish
- Loop code finishes and updates expression to evaluate to FALSE
- Introducing WHILE Loops often deals with numbers
  - %10 finds last digit
  - Other division rules
  - GCF, LCM
  - Even, Odd
  - Finding Prime numbers
- WHILE Loops are meant for more complicated iterations

### Unit 4: [2] FOR Loops
- FOR Loops can be WHILEs and vise-vers-a
  - Loop control variable, Boolean Condition, incrementing loop control variable
  - incrementing
    - FOR: at beginning, very specific
    - WHILE: at end, or in multiple statements
  - Used for traversing data structures like arrays
- "Off by one" errors: inequalities functioning with computer numbers (zero included)
  - where to start, where to finish
  - using double inequalities (>=)
- Writing short FOR & WHILE Loops that does specific counting and skip counting

- How can redundancy of checking increase the probability that the algorithm works correctly
- How many vowels exist within a word, phrase, or sentence?
  - How can I check with the least number of counting

  - Palindrome: kayak, wow, rotator, racecar, dad, civic, radar, Go Dog, Never Odd or Even
  - Palindrome Word Squares
- Students must answer how algorithms lead to code and how code can be more efficient (Big O)

### Unit 3: [5] Compound Boolean Expressions
- Nested IF, IF-ELSE, IF-ELSEIF-ELSE
- Flowchart this "choose" your own adventures


### Unit 3: [6] Equivalent Boolean Expressions
- De Morgan Law's to compare and contrast equivalent Boolean Expressions

  - !(a || b) = (!a && !b)
- Comments about not (imagine on 1D Number Line)
  - !(x>0) = (x<=0)
  - !(x<0) = (x>=0)
  - !(x>=0) = (x<0)
  - !(x<=0) = (x>0)
  - !(x==0) = (x!=0)
  - !(x!=0) = (x==0)
- Expressions to test equivalency
- How do these become AND, OR, NOT Statements, evaluated quickly?
- Using Truth Tables (2 variables, 4 rows deep)
  - P, Q P&Q, P||Q, !P, !Q, !(a && b) = (!a || !b), !(a || b) = (!a && !b)
  - Expressions to test: P||Q&&P, (P||Q)||P, P&&(P||Q)
  - Introduces idea of short-circuit in Booleans
    i.e. if (a == b || c == d || e == f), a == b is true, then rest is not evaluated because the express is evaluated
- Include examples of "Choose Own Adventure" in these examples
- Note: able to println to console to check values

### Unit 3: Comparing Objects
- ID Aliases and Null Values
- == refers to same memory location
- .equals compares the attributes of two objects to determine equivalency
