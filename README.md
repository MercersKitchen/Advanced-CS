## Coding Examples: Intro OOP Paired Programming Exemplars
- *Developing a Pong Game: visual data*
- See Summary: <a href="">Click Here</a>
- What is an Object: instance (Driver Program) and list of variables (Class Program), <a href="https://github.com/Advanced-App-Dev-and-Deploy/An-Object-Is">Click Here</a>
- What is a Constructor: assigning variables (similar to population of display geometry), <a href="https://github.com/Advanced-App-Dev-and-Deploy/A-Constructor-Is">Click Here</a>
  - Note: here population occurs in driver while variables live in class, encapsulation (security) requires population lives in class
  - Note: able to have multiple constructors in one class
  - Able to have passing parameters or no parameters, but still constructor and objects
- What is arithmetic in a class: drawing object, calculating next location, repeat (call animation), <a href="https://github.com/Advanced-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Progressions-of-Arithemtic">Click Here for Entire Repository</a>
  - This progressions illustrates encapsulation
  - See ArithemticIs, <a href="https://github.com/Advanced-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Progressions-of-Arithemtic/tree/main/ArithemticIs">Click Here</a>
    - Arithmetic in Driver
    - Object does not know about itself yet
  - See ArithemticInObject, <a href="https://github.com/Advanced-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Progressions-of-Arithemtic/tree/main/ArithemticInObject">Click Here</a>
    - Arithmetic in Object: variables are changed in Class Program and used by Driver
  - See ArithemticInClassObject, <a href="https://github.com/Advanced-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Progressions-of-Arithemtic/tree/main/ArithemticInClassObject">Click Here</a>

### Ideas to Consider  
- Additional Coding Ideas
  - Include startStop
  - Include screenSizeChecker
  - Include Access Modifiers
  - Address: ball half off the screen
  - Address: more than one ball, address initial over-lap

  Paired Programming Notes

  What is the Arithemtic to move the ball, every frame (every "step")?
  - See "ArithmeticIs", <a href="">Click Here</a>
  - Add speed variables for the X&Y Axis (width and height)
  - Change the next "step" of where the ball will be
  - Add the collisions to the ball with the Canvas Boundaries (Pong Table Edges)

  What is Class Arithmetic and how is it used?
  - See "ClassArithemtic", <a href="">Click Here</a>
  - Move the Arithmetic into the Class ... remember to remove the delimiter
  - To Ensure these lines of code are updated with each frame of ```void draw() {}```, they need to be in code block
    - ```void step () {}```
  - Remember to call the lines of code you want to update in each frame of void draw()

  What are Class Parameters and how are these used?
  - See "ClassParameters", <a href="">Click Here</a>
  - Create a Constructor with unique, ```this.```, and hard-coded values
    - Unique values for x & y
    - Hard-code diameter, color, xSpeed, & ySpeed (Shared with all Pong Balls)
  - Create the parameters of the Constructor (what will be passed)
    - Note: a value can be hard-coded and passed
  - NOTICE: the first bounce
    - ```this.``` means the individual objects are able to track their own positions, and the developer knows this by abstraction

  What does it mean to create new Objects and each object knows about it's constructor?
  - See "ClassObjects", <a href="">Click Here</a>
  - Also see "ClassObjects_Alternate"
  - Note: "ClassObjects_Alternate" introduces how Arrays can hold all values after void setup()

  CONTINUE HERE

  Create all values of object based on Ratios of Display Geometry
  - See https://github.com/QEHS-ProcessingJava/Ideas-for-OPP

  Creating a second ball
  - With and Without an Array

  Going fullScreen, simple change to ```fullScreen()```
  - need to check for Squareness?

**Using Processing-JAVA**
- Introduction to Processing-JAVA IDE
- `print` | `println`
- Hello World Program: text to Console, visual data to Canvas

//Hello World
```
/* Programmer: Mr. Mercer
Date: 20210503
Purpose: Demonstrate the System Class Method

```


**Using Pure Java**
- System Class: `System.out.print` | `System.out.println`

**[OPTIONAL] Using JavaScript & Chrome**: UNDERCONSTRUCTION, see Websites

### Unit 1: [2] Variables and Data Types
- Program design to solve a problem or task (i.e. linear vs. dynamic currently)
- Computational Thinking: domain of values and operations need to produce needed output
- Primitive or reference data types (numbers or Booleans): Booleans (1 bit) int (32-bits), double (64-bits), floating point,
- Other Data types related to Processing-Java's Visual Processing
- In Java, Strings are Classes, not primitives
- Declaring variable types based on domain & number system, and memory needed
- Difference between global and local variables

### Unit 1: [3] Expressions and Assignment Statements
- Arithmetic ()*/%+-
- Calculator project: printing buttons pressed, showing partial answers, showing final answers, maximizing memory by declaring correct variables based on domain
- Difference between "3" (three) and 3: numbers and literals
- Use casting, concatenation (introduction only, show an example only)
- integers answer in integers, with modulus
- floats and doubles can be formatted with specific decimals (truncated or rounded) by significant digits or "printing"
- Order of operations, including exponents and parenthesis, reading left to right, whatever order these are found
- ArithmeticException: divide by zero (use try-catch, if)
- NAN: not a number variable check
- flowchart about parsing numbers (logic games)
- numbers are literal values with magnitude (x=7 not same as 7=x, 7 has a fixed meaning, similar to keyword)
- what does = vs. == vs. === mean
- note: easist modulus problem is even, odd numbers
- math class: modulus problem, prime factoring (find primes, division rules to see if possible, representing in tree-diagram)

**Using Processing-JAVA**
**Using Pure Java**
**[OPTIONAL] Using JavaScript & Chrome**: UNDERCONSTRUCTION, see Websites

### Unit 1: [4] Compound Assignment Operators
- two step process: variable change, then assign or assign, then change variable
- short cuts in coding
- "counting formulae": lowest common multiples, great common factors, timers
- tracing code on paper (partner coding by printing code that works or partially works), what a complier does (HEAP Sheet)
- increment operator x++ (++x excluded): specific x+=1 or x=x+1
- decrement operator x-- (--x excluded): specific x-=1 or x=x-1

**Using Processing-JAVA**
**Using Pure Java**

### Unit 4: [1] WHILE Loops
- "When you do not know how many iterations you need"
- Note: pilot controls often use `while (true) {}`, also called an infinite loop since expression evaluates to "true" always
- need way of tracking when expression evaluates to false from within the WHILE Loop
- Mimic FOR Loop with unknown finish
- Loop code finishes and updates expression to evaluate to FALSE
- Introducing WHILE Loops often deals with numbers
  - %10 finds last digit

- Comments about not (imagine on 1D Number Line)
  - !(x>0) = (x<=0)
  - !(x<0) = (x>=0)
  - !(x>=0) = (x<0)
  - !(x<=0) = (x>0)
  - !(x==0) = (x!=0)
  - !(x!=0) = (x==0)
- Expressions to test equivalency
- How do these become AND, OR, NOT Statements, evaluated quickly?
- Using Truth Tables (2 variables, 4 rows deep)
  - P, Q P&Q, P||Q, !P, !Q, !(a && b) = (!a || !b), !(a || b) = (!a && !b)
  - Expressions to test: P||Q&&P, (P||Q)||P, P&&(P||Q)
  - Introduces idea of short-circuit in Booleans
    i.e. if (a == b || c == d || e == f), a == b is true, then rest is not evaluated because the express is evaluated
- Include examples of "Choose Own Adventure" in these examples
- Note: able to println to console to check values

### Unit 3: Comparing Objects
- ID Aliases and Null Values

Note: re-watch videos for all vocabulary words

Summary, See Course / Faculty Lectures by Unit: [1] Primitive Data Types in Java
- 2.41: simple Java Program (three different ways of declaring, assigning), remember global vs local and separated between geometry, strongly formatted language (different from other languages, amount of memory changes in strongly formatted), introduce static vs. dynamic programming in Processing-JAVA, must have decimal, create simple processing-JAVA, create simple driver-processing-Java, create simple driver-Processing-PureJava, memorize the amount of memory (time, 11:00), conserving memory as best practice, OOP creates data types that they need
