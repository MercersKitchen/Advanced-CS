# Object-based Pong Game
Exemplars

**UNDER CONSTRUCTION**
- Summarize what each does
- Illustrate coding ease of each

Pseudocode Each Type, perhaps here

Ideas to incorporate
- Right paddle to move and bounce ball (constructor values based on x-variable)
- Left paddle to move and bounce ball
- Review of Score Board
  - Review of Flat Text in Processing
  - See for complete review of CS 10: https://github.com/Intro-CS-App-Dev-and-Deploy/Overview#computer-apps
- Caution: may need to move code from Main Program to Classes based on inheritance
- Inheritance: Score Board and Reset Button
  - See Design Hierarchy in Pong OPP Lessons (i.e. https://github.com/MercersKitchen/Advanced-CS/tree/main/Pong%20OPP%20Lessons/Class%20Design%20Hierarchy)
- Modifiers
- Static Classes

# O Pong Basic Classes

## Object Ball

Caution: this is a circle drawing class

Behaviours
- New ball has different colour
- All balls start in center
- Random direction

- Most code into Constructor
- gameStart() is procedure that should be in Constructor

Vocabular to Review
- Array List (similar to Array), but for objects
- Main or Driver Program, where code from objects are referenced and executed
- Variables, Constructor (population), Procedural Organization

---

## Object Paddle

Caution: this is a rectangle drawing class

Progressions (not only two paddles)
- Draw paddles
- Make paddles move (different formula will make paddles move in different ways)
- If Paddle goes off screen, redraw it on the screen

There will be other rectangles to draw on the screen

# Ideas to Include
Pseudocode Each Type, perhaps here

Concepts to Include
- Access Modifiers: public, private, static, final
- Inheritance

Objects to Create
- Ball Object: Pong Ball, Emphasis Ball Explosion
  - Knows about x, y, radius
  - Knows about max radius
  - knows about it's speed (not -1 & 1 any more)
- Paddle: left and right
- Scoreboard
